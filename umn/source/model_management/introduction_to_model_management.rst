Introduction to Model Management
================================

AI model development and optimization require frequent iterations and debugging. Changes in datasets, training code, or parameters may affect the quality of models. If the metadata of the development process cannot be managed in a unified manner, the optimal model may fail to be reproduced.

ModelArts model management allows you to import models generated with all training versions to manage all iterated and debugged models in a unified manner.

Usage Restrictions
------------------

-  In an automatic learning project, after a model is deployed, the model is automatically uploaded to the model management list. However, models generated by automatic learning cannot be downloaded and can be used only for deployment and rollout.
