Managing Visualization Jobs
===========================

You can create visualization jobs of TensorBoard and MindInsight types on ModelArts.

TensorBoard supports training jobs based on the TensorFlow engine, and MindInsight supports training jobs based on the MindSpore engine.

TensorBoard and MindInsight can effectively display the change trend of a training job and the data used in the training.

You can use the **summary** file generated during model training to create a visualization job.

Prerequisites
-------------

To ensure that the **summary** file is generated in the training result, you need to add the related code to the training script.

-  Using the TensorFlow engine:

   When using the TensorFlow-based MoXing, in **mox.run**, set **save_summary_steps>0** and **summary_verbosityâ‰¥1**.

   If you want to display other metrics, add tensors to **log_info** in the return value **mox.ModelSpec** of **model_fn**. Only the rank-0 tensors (scalars) are supported. The added tensors are written into the **summary** file. If you want to write tensors of higher ranks in the **summary** file, use the native **tf.summary** of TensorFlow in **model_fn**.

-  Using the MindSpore engine:

   MindSpore allows you to save data to the **summary** log file and display the data on the GUI. For details, see the `MindSpore official website <https://www.mindspore.cn/mindinsight/docs/en/r1.3/summary_record.html>`__.

Creating a Visualization Job
----------------------------

#. Log in to the ModelArts management console. In the left navigation pane, choose **Training Jobs**. On the displayed page, click the **Visualization Jobs** tab.

#. In the upper left corner of the visualization job list, click **Create** to switch to the **Create Visualization Job** page.

#. Set **Job Type** to **TensorBoard** and **MindInsight**. Enter the visualization job name and description as required, set the **Training Output Path** and **Auto Stop** parameters.

   -  **Training Output Path**: Select the training output path specified when the training job is created.
   -  **Auto Stop**: Enable or disable the auto stop function. The options are **1 hour later**, **2 hours later**, **4 hours later**, **6 hours later**, and **Custom**. If you select **Custom**, you can enter any integer within 1 to 24 hours in the textbox on the right.

#. After confirming the specifications, click **Next**.

   In the visualization job list, when the status changes to **Running**, the virtualization job has been created. You can click the name of the visualization job to view its details.

Opening a Visualization Job
---------------------------

In the visualization job list, click the name of the target visualization job. The **TensorBoard** page is displayed. Only the visualization job in the **Running** status can be opened.

Running or Stopping a Visualization Job
---------------------------------------

-  **Stopping a visualization job**: In the visualization job list, click **Stop** in the **Operation** column to stop the visualization job.
-  **Running a visualization job**: You can run and use a visualization job in the **Canceled** status again. In the visualization job list, click **Run** in the **Operation** column to run the visualization job.

Deleting a Visualization Job
----------------------------

If your visualization job is no longer used, you can delete it to release resources. In the visualization job list, click **Delete** in the **Operation** column to delete the visualization job.

.. note::

   A deleted visualized job cannot be recovered. You need to create a new visualization job if you want to use it. Exercise caution when performing this operation.
