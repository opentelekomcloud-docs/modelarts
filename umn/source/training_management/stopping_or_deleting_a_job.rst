Stopping or Deleting a Job
==========================

Stopping a Training Job
-----------------------

In the training job list, click **Stop** in the **Operation** column for a training job in the **Running** state to stop a running training job.

If you have selected **Save Training Parameters** for a stopped training job, the job's parameter settings will be saved to the **Job Parameter Mgmt** page.

You cannot stop a training job that has stopped running, for example the job in the **Successful** or **Running failed** state. Only training jobs in the **Running** state can be stopped.

Deleting a Training Job
-----------------------

If an existing training job is no longer used, you can delete it.

For a training job in the **Running**, **Successful**, **Running failed**, **Canceled**, or **Deploying** state, click **Delete** in the **Operation** column to delete it.

If you have selected **Save Training Parameters** for a deleted training job, the job's parameter settings will be saved to the **Job Parameter Mgmt** page.
