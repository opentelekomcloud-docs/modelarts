Introduction to Training Jobs
=============================

ModelArts supports multiple types of training jobs during the entire AI development process. Select a creation mode based on the algorithm source.

Algorithm Sources of Training Jobs
----------------------------------

-  **Frequently-used**

   If you have used some frequently-used frameworks to develop algorithms locally, you can select a frequently-used framework and create a training job to build a model. For details, see `Using Frequently-used Frameworks to Train Models <modelarts_23_0238.html>`__.

-  **Custom**

   If the framework used for algorithm development is not a frequently-used framework, you can build an algorithm into a custom image and use the custom image to create a training job. For details about the operation guide to create a training job, see `Using Custom Images to Train Models <modelarts_23_0239.html>`__. For details about the specifications and description of custom images, see `Specifications for Custom Images Used for Training Jobs <modelarts_23_0217.html>`__.
