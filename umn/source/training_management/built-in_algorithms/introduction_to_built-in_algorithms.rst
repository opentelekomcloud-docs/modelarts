Introduction to Built-in Algorithms
===================================

Based on the frequently-used AI engines in the industry, ModelArts provides built-in algorithms to meet a wide range of your requirements. You can directly select the algorithms for training jobs, without concerning model development.

Built-in algorithms of ModelArts adopt MXNet and TensorFlow engines and are mainly used for detection of object classes and locations, image classification, and semantic image segmentation.

Viewing Built-in Algorithms
---------------------------

In the left navigation pane of the ModelArts management console, choose **Training Management** > **Training Jobs**. On the displayed page, click **Built-in Algorithms**. In the built-in algorithm list, click |image1| next to an algorithm name to view details about the algorithm.

You can click **Create Training Job** in the **Operation** column for an algorithm to quickly create a training job, for which this algorithm serves as the **Algorithm Source**.

.. note::

   Before using a built-in algorithm to create a training job, prepare and upload training data to OBS. For details about the data storage path and data format requirements, see :ref:`Requirements on Datasets <modelarts_23_0157>`.
