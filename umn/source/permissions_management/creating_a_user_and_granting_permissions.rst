Creating a User and Granting Permissions
========================================

Policy Content
--------------

A fine-grained policy consists of the policy version (the **Version** field) and statement (the **Statement** field).

-  **Version**: Distinguishes between role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained policies.

   -  **1.0**: RBAC policies, which are preset in the system and used to grant permissions of each service as a whole. After such a policy is granted to a user, the user has all permissions of the corresponding service.
   -  **1.1**: Fine-grained policies. A fine-grained policy consists of API-based permissions for operations on specific resource types. Fine-grained policies, as the name suggests, allow for more fine-grained control than RBAC policies. Users granted permissions of such a policy can only perform specific operations on the corresponding service. Fine-grained policies are classified into default and custom policies.

      -  Default policies: Preset common permission sets to control read and administrator permissions of different services.
      -  Custom policies: Permission sets created and managed by users as an extension and supplement to system-defined policies. For example, a custom policy can be created to allow users only to modify ECS specifications.

-  **Statement**: Detailed information about a policy, containing the **Effect** and **Action** elements.

   -  Effect

      Valid values for **Effect** include **Allow** and **Deny**. In a custom policy that contains both Allow and Deny statements, the Deny statements take precedence.

   -  Action

      The value can be one or more resource operations.

      The value format is *Service name*:*Resource type*:*Action*, for example, **modelarts:exemlProject:create**.

      .. note::

         -  *Service name*: service name. Only lowercase letters are supported, for example, **modelarts**.
         -  *Resource type* and *Action*: The values are case-insensitive, and the wildcard (*) are allowed. A wildcard (*) can represent all or part of information about resource types and actions for the specific service.

Example Policies
----------------

-  A policy can define a single permission, such as the permission to deny ExeML project deletion.

   .. code-block::

      { 
            "Version": "1.1", 
            "Statement": [ 
                  { 
                "Effect": "Deny", 
                        "Action": [ 
                              "modelarts:exemlProject:delete" 
                        ] 
                  } 
            ] 
      }

-  A policy can define multiple permissions, such as the permissions to delete an ExeML version and an ExeML project.

   .. code-block::

      { 
          "Version": "1.1", 
          "Statement": [ 
              { 
                  "Effect": "Allow", 
                  "Action": [ 
                      "modelarts:exemlProjectVersion:delete", 
                      "modelarts:exemlProject:delete" 
                  ] 
              } 
          ] 
      }

Authentication Logic
--------------------

IAM authenticates users according to the permissions that the users have been granted. The authentication logic is as follows:

.. note::

   The actions in each policy bear the OR relationship.

#. A user accesses the system and makes an operation request.
#. The system evaluates all the permissions policies assigned to the user.
#. In these policies, the system looks for explicit deny permissions. If the system finds an explicit deny that applies, it returns a decision of **Deny**, and the authentication ends.
#. If no explicit deny is found, the system looks for allow permissions that would apply to the request. If the system finds an explicit allow permission that applies, it returns a decision of **Allow**, and the authentication ends.
#. If no explicit allow permission is found, the system returns a decision of **Deny**, and the authentication ends.
