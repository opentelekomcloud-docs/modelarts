Creating an OBS Bucket
======================

ModelArts uses OBS to store data and model backups and snapshots, achieving secure, reliable, and low-cost storage. Therefore, before using ModelArts, create an OBS bucket and folders for storing data.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to OBS Console and create an OBS bucket. For details, see "Creating a Bucket". For example, create an OBS bucket named **c-flowers**.

   .. note::

      The created OBS bucket and ModelArts are in the same region.

#. Create a folder for storing data. For details, see "Creating a Folder". For example, create a folder named **flowers** in the created **c-flowers** OBS bucket.
