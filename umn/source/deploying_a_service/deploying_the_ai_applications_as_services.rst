Deploying the AI Applications as Services
=========================================

After a training job is complete and an AI application is generated, you can deploy the model on the **Service Deployment** page. You can also deploy the model imported from OBS. ModelArts supports the following deployment types:

-  :ref:`Real-Time Services <modelarts_23_0060>`

   Deploy an AI application as a web service to provide real-time test UI and monitoring.

-  :ref:`Batch Services <modelarts_23_0066>`

   A batch service can perform inference on batch data. After data processing is complete, the batch service automatically stops.
