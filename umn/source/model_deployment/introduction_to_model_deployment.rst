Introduction to Model Deployment
================================

After a training job is complete and a model is generated, you can deploy the model on the **Service Deployment** page. You can also deploy the model imported from OBS. ModelArts supports the following deployment types:

-  `Real-Time Services <modelarts_23_0060.html>`__

   Deploy a model as a web service to provide real-time test UI and monitoring capabilities.

-  `Batch Services <modelarts_23_0066.html>`__

   A batch service can perform inference on batch data. After data processing is complete, the batch service automatically stops.
