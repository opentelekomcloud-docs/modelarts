Modifying a Service
===================

For a deployed service, you can modify its basic information to match service changes. You can modify the basic information about a service in either of the following ways:

`Method 1: Modify Service Information on the Service Management Page <#method-1--modify-service-information-on-the-service-management-page>`__

`Method 2: Modify Service Information on the Service Details Page <#method-2--modify-service-information-on-the-service-details-page>`__

Prerequisites

A service has been deployed.

Method 1: Modify Service Information on the Service Management Page

#. Log in to the ModelArts management console and choose **Service Deployment** from the left navigation pane. Go to the service management page of the target service.
#. In the service list, click **Modify** in the **Operation** column of the target service, modify basic service information, and click **OK**.
