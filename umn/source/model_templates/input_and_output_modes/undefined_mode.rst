Undefined Mode
==============

Description
-----------

The undefined mode does not define the input and output mode. The input and output mode is determined by the model. Select this mode only when the existing input and output mode is not applicable to the application scenario of the model. The models imported in undefined mode cannot be deployed as batch services. In addition, the service prediction page may not be displayed properly. New modes are coming soon for more application scenarios.

Input
-----

No limit.

Output
------

No limit.

Sample Request
--------------

The undefined mode has no specific sample request because the input and output of the request are entirely determined by the model.
