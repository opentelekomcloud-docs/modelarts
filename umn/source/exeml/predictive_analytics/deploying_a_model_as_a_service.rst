Deploying a Model as a Service
==============================

Deploying a Model
-----------------

You can deploy a model as a real-time service that provides a real-time test UI and monitoring capabilities. After model training is complete, you can deploy a version with the ideal accuracy and in the **Successful** status as a service. The procedure is as follows:

#. On the **Train Model** tab page, wait until the training status changes to **Completed**. Click **Deploy** in the **Version Manager** pane.

#. In the displayed **Deploy** dialog box, set **Specifications**, and click **OK** to deploy the model as a real-time service.

   -  **Specifications**: **Compute-intensive 1 instance (CPU)** are supported.

   -  **Compute Nodes**: The default value is **1** and cannot be changed.

   -  **Auto Stop**: After this parameter is enabled and the auto stop time is set, a service automatically stops at the specified time. If this parameter is disabled, a real-time service is always running and billed. The function can help you avoid unnecessary charges. The auto stop function is enabled by default. The default value is **1 hour later**.

      Currently, the options are **1 hour later**, **2 hours later**, **4 hours later**, **6 hours later**, and **Custom**. If you select **Custom**, you can enter any integer from 1 to 24 hours in the text box on the right.

#. After the model is deployed, view the model deployment status on the **Service Deployment** page.

   The deployment takes a certain period of time. If the status in the **Version Manager** pane changes from **Deploying** to **Running**, the deployment is complete.

Testing a Service
-----------------

-  On the **Service Deployment** page, select a service type. For example, on the ExeML page, the predictive analytics model is deployed as a real-time service by default. On the **Real-Time Services** page, click **Prediction** in the **Operation** column of the target service to perform a service test. For details, see `Testing a Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/modelarts/modelarts_23_0062.html>`__.
-  You can also use code to test a service. For details, see `Accessing a Real-Time Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/modelarts/modelarts_23_0063.html>`__.
-  The following describes the procedure for performing a service test after the predictive analytics model is deployed as a service on the ExeML page.

   #. After the model is deployed, you can test the model using code. On the **ExeML** page, click the target project, go to the **Deployment Online** tab page, select the service version in the **Running** state, and enter the code in the **Code** area.
   #. Click **Prediction** to perform the test. After the prediction is complete, the result is displayed in the **Return Result** area on the right. If the model accuracy does not meet your expectation, train and deploy the model again on the **Label Data** tab page. If you are satisfied with the model prediction result, call the API to access the real-time service as prompted. For details, see `Accessing a Real-Time Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/modelarts/modelarts_23_0063.html>`__.

      -  **attr_1** to **attr_7** indicate the input data. On the **Label Data** tab page, the selected label column is **attr_7**, that is, **attr_7** is the target column to be predicted. The value of **attr_7** can be set to any value or left blank, which does not affect the prediction result.

         +-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+

      -  In the preceding code snippet, **predictioncol** is the inference result of label column **attr_7**.

      .. note::

         A running real-time service keeps consuming the resources. If you do not need to use the real-time service, you are advised to click **Stop** in the **Version Manager** pane to stop the service. If you want to use the service again, click **Start**.
