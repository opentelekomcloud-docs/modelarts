Deploying a Model as a Service
==============================

Deploying a Model
-----------------

You can deploy a model as a real-time service that provides a real-time test UI and monitoring capabilities. After model training is complete, you can deploy a version with the ideal accuracy and in the **Successful** status as a service. The procedure is as follows:

#. On the **Train Model** tab page, wait until the training status changes to **Successful**. Click **Deploy** in the **Version Manager** pane to deploy the model as a real-time service.

#. In the **Deploy** dialog box, select resource flavor, set the **Auto Stop** function, and click **OK** to start the deployment.

   -  **Specifications**: The GPU specifications are better, and the CPU specifications are more cost-effective.
   -  **Compute Nodes**: The default value is **1** and cannot be changed.
   -  **Auto Stop**: After this function is enabled and the auto stop time is set, a service automatically stops at the specified time.

   The options are **1 hour later**, **2 hours later**, **4 hours later**, **6 hours later**, and **Custom**. If you select **Custom**, you can enter any integer from 1 to 24 hours in the text box on the right.

#. After the model deployment is started, view the deployment status on the **Service Deployment** page.

   It takes a certain period of time to deploy a model. When the status in the **Version Manager** pane changes from **Deploying** to **Running**, the deployment is complete.

   .. note::

      On the **ExeML** page, trained models can only be deployed as real-time services. For details about how to deploy them as batch services, see :ref:`Where Are Models Generated by ExeML Stored? What Other Operations Are Supported? <modelarts_21_0034>`

Testing a Service
-----------------

-  On the **Service Deployment** page, select a service type. For example, on the ExeML page, the object detection model is deployed as a real-time service by default. On the **Real-Time Services** page, click **Prediction** in the **Operation** column of the target service to perform a service test. For details, see `Testing a Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/modelarts/modelarts_23_0062.html>`__.
-  You can also use code to test a service. For details, see `Accessing a Real-Time Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/modelarts/modelarts_23_0063.html>`__.
-  The following describes the procedure for performing a service test after the object detection model is deployed as a service on the ExeML page.

   #. After the model is deployed, test the service using an image. On the **ExeML** page, click the target project, go to the **Deploy Service** tab page, select the service version in the **Running** status, click **Upload** in the service test area, and upload a local image to perform the test.

   #. Click **Predict** to perform the test. After the prediction is complete, the result is displayed in the **Test Result** pane on the right. If the model accuracy does not meet your expectation, add images on the **Label Data** tab page, label the images, and train and deploy the model again. :ref:`Table 1 <modelarts_21_0013__en-us_topic_0284258842_en-us_topic_0169446262_table27971626122015>` describes the parameters in the prediction result. If you are satisfied with the model prediction result, call the API to access the real-time service as prompted. For details, see `Accessing a Real-Time Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/modelarts/modelarts_23_0063.html>`__.

      Currently, only JPG, JPEG, BMP, and PNG images are supported.

      .. note::

         A running real-time service keeps consuming resources. If you do not need to use the real-time service, click **Stop** in the **Version Manager** pane to stop the service. If you want to use the service again, click **Start**.

         If you enable the auto stop function, the service automatically stops after the specified time and no fee is generated.
