Where Are Models Generated by ExeML Stored? What Other Operations Are Supported?
================================================================================

Unified Model Management
------------------------

For an ExeML project, after the model training is complete, the generated model is automatically displayed on the Model Management page. The model name is automatically generated by the system. Its prefix is the same as the name of the ExeML project for easy identification.

.. caution::

   Models generated by ExeML cannot be downloaded.

What Other Operations Are Supported for Models Generated by ExeML?
------------------------------------------------------------------

-  **Deploying models as real-time and batch services**

   On the **ExeML** page, models can only be deployed as real-time services. You can deploy models as batch services on the **Model Management** page.

-  **Creating a version**

   When creating a new version, you can select a meta model only from a ModelArts training job, OBS, model template, or custom image. You cannot create a version from the original ExeML project.
