To add data for an existing project, perform the following operations. The operations described in this section apply only to object detection and image classification projects.

Obtaining the Data Source of an ExeML Project

#. Log in to the ModelArts management console and choose **ExeML** from the left navigation pane.
#. In the ExeML project list, you can view the data source corresponding to the project in the **Data Source** column. Click your desired data source link to go to the dataset selected or created during project creation.

Uploading New Data to OBS
-------------------------

Log in to OBS Console, access the data storage path, and upload new data to OBS.

For details about how to upload files to OBS, see **Uploading an Object**.

Synchronizing Data to ModelArts
-------------------------------

#. After data is uploaded to OBS, go to the **ExeML** page on the ModelArts management console.

#. In the ExeML project list, select the project to which data is to be added and click the project name. The **Label Data** page is displayed.
