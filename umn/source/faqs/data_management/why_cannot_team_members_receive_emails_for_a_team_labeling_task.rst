Why Cannot Team Members Receive Emails for a Team Labeling Task?
================================================================

The possible causes are as follows:

-  All dataset data has been labeled. An email can be sent to team members only if there is unlabeled data in the dataset when the team labeling task is created.
-  Team members receive emails for team labeling tasks. No email will be sent when you create a labeling team or add members to a labeling team.
-  Your email address has not been configured or has been incorrectly configured. For details about how to configure an email address, see .
-  Team members' email addresses are blocked.
