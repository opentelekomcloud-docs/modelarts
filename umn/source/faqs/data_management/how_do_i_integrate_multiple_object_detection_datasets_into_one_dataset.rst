How Do I Integrate Multiple Object Detection Datasets into One Dataset?
=======================================================================

Create a parent directory in an OBS bucket, in the directory add the same number of folders as that of datasets, export one dataset to one folder, and use the parent directory to create a dataset.

Log in to the ModelArts management console and choose **Data Management** > **Datasets**. Click the target dataset to switch to its **Dashboard** page. Then, click **Export** in the upper right corner of the page to export the dataset to a folder in the OBS parent directory.
