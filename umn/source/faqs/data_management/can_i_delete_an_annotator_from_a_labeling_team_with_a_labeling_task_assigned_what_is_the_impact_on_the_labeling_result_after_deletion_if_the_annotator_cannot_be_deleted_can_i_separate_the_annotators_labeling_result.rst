Can I Delete an Annotator from a Labeling Team with a Labeling Task Assigned? What Is the Impact on the Labeling Result After Deletion? If the Annotator Cannot Be Deleted, Can I Separate the Annotator's Labeling Result?
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

No annotator cannot be deleted from a labeling team with labeling tasks assigned.

The labeling result of an annotator can be synchronized to the overall labeling result only after the annotator's labeling is approved, and the labeling result cannot be filtered.
