Where Will the Data Be Uploaded to?
===================================

Data may be stored in OBS or EVS, depending on which kind of storage you have configured for your Notebook instances:

-  OBS

   After you click **upload**, the data is directly uploaded to the target OBS path specified when the notebook instance was created.

-  EVS

   After you click **upload**, the data is uploaded to the instance container, that is, the **~/work** directory on the **Terminal** page.
