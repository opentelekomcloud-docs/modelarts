What Should I Do If DevEnviron Prompts Insufficient Space?
==========================================================

If space is insufficient, use notebook instances of the EVS type.

Upload code and data to an OBS bucket for the original notebook instance by referring to :ref:`How Do I Upload a File from a Notebook Instance to OBS or Download a File from OBS to a Notebook Instance? <modelarts_05_0024>`. Then, create a notebook instance of the EVS type, and download files from OBS to the new notebook instance.
