What Do I Do If Files Fail to Be Saved in JupyterLab?
=====================================================

Symptom
-------

When a file is saved in JupyterLab, an error message is displayed.

Possible Cause
--------------

A third-party plug-in has been installed on the browser, and the proxy intercepts the request. As a result, the file cannot be saved.

Solution
--------

Disable the plug-in and save file again.
