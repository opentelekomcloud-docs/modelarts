What Are the Relationships Between Files Stored in JupyterLab, Terminal, and OBS?
=================================================================================

-  Files stored in JupyterLab are the same as those in the work directory on the **Terminal** page. That is, the files are created on your notebook instances or synchronized from OBS.
-  Notebook instances with OBS storage mounted can synchronize files from OBS to JupyterLab using the Sync OBS function. The files on the **Terminal** page are the same as those in JupyterLab.
-  Notebook instances with EVS storage mounted can read files from OBS to JupyterLab using the MoXing API or SDKs. The files on the **Terminal** page are the same as those in JupyterLab.
