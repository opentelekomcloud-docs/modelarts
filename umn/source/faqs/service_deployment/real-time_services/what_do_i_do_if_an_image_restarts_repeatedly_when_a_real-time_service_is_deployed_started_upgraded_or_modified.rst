What Do I Do If an Image Restarts Repeatedly When a Real-Time Service Is Deployed, Started, Upgraded, or Modified?
==================================================================================================================

Possible Cause
--------------

There is a bug in the container image code.

Solution
--------

Debug the container image code based on container logs, create the model again, and deploy the application as a real-time service.
