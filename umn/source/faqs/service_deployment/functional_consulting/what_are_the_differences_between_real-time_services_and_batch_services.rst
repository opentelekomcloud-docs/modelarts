What Are the Differences Between Real-Time Services and Batch Services?
=======================================================================

-  Real-Time Services

   Models are deployed as web services. You can access the services through the management console or APIs.

-  Batch Services

   A batch service performs inference on batch data and automatically stops after data processing is completed.

A batch service processes batch data at a time. A real-time service provides APIs for you to call.
