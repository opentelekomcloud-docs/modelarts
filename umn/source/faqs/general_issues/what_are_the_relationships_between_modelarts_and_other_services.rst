What Are The Relationships Between ModelArts And Other Services
===============================================================

IAM
---

ModelArts uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication and authorization. For more information about IAM, see `Identity and Access Management User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/iam/index.html>`__.

OBS
---

ModelArts uses Object Storage Service (OBS) to store data and model backups and snapshots. OBS provides secure, reliable, low-cost storage. For more details, see `Object Storage Service Console Function Overview <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/obs/index.html>`__.

CCE
---

ModelArts uses Cloud Container Engine (CCE) to deploy models as real-time services. CCE enables high concurrency and provides elastic scaling. For more information about CCE, see `Cloud Container Engine User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/cce/index.html>`__.

SWR
---

To use an AI framework that is not supported by ModelArts, use SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) to customize an image and import the image to ModelArts for training or inference. For more details, see `SoftWare Repository for Container User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/swr/index.html>`__.
