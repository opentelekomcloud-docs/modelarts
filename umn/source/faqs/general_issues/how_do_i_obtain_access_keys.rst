How Do I Obtain Access Keys?
============================

Obtaining an Access Key
-----------------------

#. Log in to the console, enter the **My Credentials** page, and choose **Access Keys** > **Create Access Key**.
#. In the **Create Access Key** dialog box that is displayed, use the login password for verification.
#. Click **OK**, open the **credentials.csv** file, and save the key file as prompted. The access key file is saved in the default download folder of the browser. Then, the access key (**Access Key Id** and **Secret Access Key**) is obtained.
