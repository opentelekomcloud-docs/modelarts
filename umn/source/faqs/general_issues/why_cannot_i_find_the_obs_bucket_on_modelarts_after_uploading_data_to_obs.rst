Why Cannot I Find the OBS Bucket on ModelArts After Uploading Data to OBS?
==========================================================================

If an OBS directory needs to be specified for using ModelArts functions, such as creating training jobs and datasets, ensure that the OBS bucket and ModelArts are in the same region.

If you cannot select the OBS bucket that you have created on the window for specifying an OBS directory, go to OBS Console, and check whether the OBS bucket and ModelArts are in the same region or whether the OBS bucket belongs to another account.
