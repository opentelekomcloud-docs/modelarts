What Are the Differences Between ModelArts and DLS?
===================================================

Deep Learning Service (DLS) is a one-stop deep learning platform . With various optimized neural network models, DLS allows you to easily implement model training and evaluation with the flexibility of on-demand scheduling.

However, DLS supports only the deep learning technologies, while ModelArts integrates both the deep learning and machine learning technologies. In addition, ModelArts is a one-stop AI development platform, which manages the AI development lifecycle from data labeling, algorithm development, to model training and deployment. To be specific, ModelArts contains and supports the functions and features of DLS. Currently, DLS is terminated . The functions related to deep learning can be directly used in ModelArts. If you are a DLS user, you can also migrate the data in DLS to ModelArts.
