What Is ExeML?
==============

ExeML is the process of automating model design, parameter tuning, and model training, compression, and deployment with the labeled data. The process is free of coding and does not require developers' experience in model development.

Users who do not have encoding capability can use the labeling, one-click model training, and model deployment functions of ExeML to build AI models.
