What Type of Service Is Deployed in ExeML?
==========================================

Models created in ExeML are deployed as real-time services. You can add images or compile code to test the services, as well as call the APIs using the URLs.

After model development is successful, you can choose **Service Deployment** > **Real-Time Services** in the left navigation pane of the ModelArts console to view running services, and stop or delete services.
