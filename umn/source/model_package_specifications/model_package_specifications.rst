Model Package Specifications
============================

When you import models in **Model Management**, if the meta model is imported from OBS or a container image, the model package must meet the following specifications:

-  The model package must contain the **model** directory. The **model** directory stores the model file, model configuration file, and model inference code.
-  The model configuration file must exist and its name is fixed to **config.json**. There exists only one model configuration file. For details about how to compile the model configuration file, see `Specifications for Compiling the Model Configuration File <../model_package_specifications/specifications_for_compiling_the_model_configuration_file.html>`__.
-  The model inference code file is optional. If this file is required, the file name is fixed to **customize_service.py**. There must be one and only one such file. For details about how to compile the model inference code, see `Specifications for Compiling Model Inference Code <../model_package_specifications/specifications_for_compiling_model_inference_code.html>`__.

   .. note::

      -  The **.py** file on which **customize_service.py** depends can be directly stored in the **model** directory. Use the Python import mode to import the custom package.
      -  The other files on which **customize_service.py** depends can be stored in the **model** directory. You must use absolute paths to access these files. For more details, see `Obtaining an Absolute Path <../model_package_specifications/specifications_for_compiling_model_inference_code.html#modelarts230093enustopic0172466150li135956421288>`__.

ModelArts also provides custom script examples of common AI engines. For details, see `Examples of Custom Scripts <../examples_of_custom_scripts/tensorflow.html>`__.
