Logging In to ModelArts
=======================

Typically, users label data in **Data Management** of the ModelArts console. **Data Management** provides data management capabilities such as dataset management, data labeling, data import and export, auto labeling, and team labeling and management. After a team labeling job is created, team members can log in to the ModelArts console to view the job.

#. After a labeling job is created, receive a labeling notification email as a team member to which the job is assigned.
#. Click the labeling job link in the email. The **Data Management** > **Data Labeling** > **My Participations** tab on the ModelArts console is displayed.
#. In the **My Participations** tab, you can view your labeling jobs.

If a team member has bound an email address, the team member can receive a job notification email and access the data labeling console using the address provided in the email.

Upon your login, only the team labeling jobs and related data of the current user (the mailbox user) are displayed.
