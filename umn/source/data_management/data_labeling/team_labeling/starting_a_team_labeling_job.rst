Starting a Team Labeling Job
============================

After logging in to the data labeling page on the management console, you can click the **My Participations** tab to view the assigned labeling job and click the job name to go to the labeling page. The labeling method varies depending on the labeling job type. For details, see the following:

-  :ref:`Image Classification <datalabel-modelarts_0006>`
-  :ref:`Object Detection <datalabel-modelarts_0007>`
-  :ref:`Text Classification <datalabel-modelarts_0010>`
-  :ref:`Named Entity Recognition <datalabel-modelarts_0011>`
-  :ref:`Text Triplet <datalabel-modelarts_0012>`
-  :ref:`Speech Paragraph Labeling <datalabel-modelarts_0016>`

On the labeling page, each member can view the images that are not labeled, to be confirmed, rejected, to be reviewed, approved, and accepted. Pay attention to the images rejected by the administrator and the images to be corrected.

If the Reviewer role is assigned for a team labeling job, the labeling result needs to be reviewed. After the labeling result is reviewed, it is submitted to the administrator for acceptance.
