Named Entity Recognition
========================

Named entity recognition assigns labels to named entities in text, such as time and locations. Before labeling, you need to understand the following:

-  A label name can contain a maximum of 32 characters, including Chinese characters, letters, digits, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

Starting Labeling
-----------------

#. Log in to the ModelArts management console. In the left navigation pane, choose **Data Management** > **Datasets**. The **Datasets** page is displayed.

#. In the dataset list, select the dataset to be labeled based on the labeling type, and click the dataset name to go to the **Dashboard** tab page of the dataset.

   By default, the **Dashboard** tab page of the current dataset version is displayed. If you need to label the dataset of another version, click the **Versions** tab and then click **Set to Current Version** in the right pane. For details, see :ref:`Managing Dataset Versions <modelarts_23_0019>`.

#. On the **Dashboard** page of the dataset, click **Label** in the upper right corner. The dataset details page is displayed. By default, all data of the dataset is displayed on the dataset details page.
