Text Classification
===================

Model training requires a large amount of labeled data. Therefore, before the model training, add labels to the files that are not labeled. In addition, you can modify, delete, and re-label the labeled text.

Text classification classifies text content based on labels. Before labeling text content, you need to understand the following:

-  Text labeling supports multiple labels. That is, you can add multiple labels to a labeling object.
-  A label name can contain a maximum of 32 characters, including Chinese characters, letters, digits, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

Starting Labeling
-----------------

#. Log in to the ModelArts management console. In the left navigation pane, choose **Data Management** > **Datasets**. The **Datasets** page is displayed.

#. In the dataset list, select the dataset to be labeled based on the labeling type, and click the dataset name to go to the **Dashboard** tab page of the dataset.

   By default, the **Dashboard** tab page of the current dataset version is displayed. If you need to label the dataset of another version, click the **Versions** tab and then click **Set to Current Version** in the right pane. For details, see `Managing Dataset Versions <../../data_management/managing_dataset_versions.html>`__.

#. On the **Dashboard** page of the dataset, click **Label** in the upper right corner. The dataset details page is displayed. By default, all data of the dataset is displayed on the dataset details page.

Labeling Content
----------------

The dataset details page displays the labeled and unlabeled text files in the dataset. The **Unlabeled** tab page is displayed by default.

#. On the **Unlabeled** tab page, the objects to be labeled are listed in the left pane. In the list, click the text object to be labeled, and select a label in the **Label Set** area in the right pane. Multiple labels can be added to a labeling object.

   You can repeat this operation to select objects and add labels to the objects.

#. After all objects are labeled, click **Save Current Page** at the bottom of the page to complete labeling text files on the **Unlabeled** tab page.

Adding Labels
-------------

-  Adding labels on the **Unlabeled** tab page: Click the plus sign (+) next to **Label Set**. On the **Add Label** page that is displayed, add a label name, select a label color, and click **OK**.

-  Adding labels on the **Labeled** tab page: Click the plus sign (+) next to **All Labels**. On the **Add Label** page that is displayed, add a label name, select a label color, and click **OK**.

Viewing the Labeled Text
------------------------

On the dataset details page, click the **Labeled** tab to view the list of the labeled text. You can also view all labels supported by the dataset in the **All Labels** area on the right.

Modifying Labeled Data
----------------------

After labeling data, you can modify labeled data on the **Labeled** tab page.

-  **Modifying based on texts**

   On the dataset details page, click the **Labeled** tab, and select the text to be modified from the text list.

   In the text list, click the text. When the text background turns blue, the text is selected. If a text file has multiple labels, you can click |image1| above a label to delete the label.

-  **Modifying based on labels**

   On the dataset details page, click the **Labeled** tab. The information about all labels is displayed on the right.

   -  Batch modification: In the **All Labels** area, click the editing icon in the **Operation** column, modify the label name in the text box, select a label color, and click **OK**.
   -  Batch deletion: In the **All Labels** area, click the deletion icon in the **Operation** column to delete the label. In the dialog box that is displayed, select **Delete label** or **Delete label and objects with only the label**, and click **OK**.

Adding Files
------------

In addition to automatically synchronizing data from **Input Dataset Path**, you can directly add text files on ModelArts for data labeling.

#. On the dataset details page, click the **Unlabeled** tab. Then click **Add File**.

#. In the displayed **Add File** dialog box, set the parameters as required and then select the file to be uploaded.

   Select one or more files to be uploaded in the local environment. Only **.txt** and **.csv** files are supported. The total size of files uploaded at a time cannot exceed 8 MB. **Text and Label Separator** and **Label Separator** must be different.

   -  **Pattern**: Select **Merge text objects and labels** or **Separate text objects and labels**. An example is provided. Determine the mode of the file to be added by referring to the example.
   -  **Text and Label Separator**: Select **Tab**, **Space**, **Semicolon**, **Comma**, or **Other**. If you select **Other**, enter a separator in the text box on the right.
   -  **Label Separator**: Select **Tab**, **Space**, **Semicolon**, **Comma**, or **Other**. If you select **Other**, enter a separator in the text box on the right.

#. In the **Add File** dialog box, click **Upload**. The files you add will be automatically displayed on the **Unlabeled** or **Labeled** tab page.

Deleting a File
---------------

You can quickly delete the files you want to discard.

-  On the **Unlabeled** tab page, select the text to be deleted, and click **Delete** in the upper left corner to delete the text.
-  On the **Labeled** tab page, select the text to be deleted and click **Delete**. Alternatively, you can tick **Select Images on Current Page** to select all text objects on the current page and click **Delete** in the upper left corner.

The background of the selected text is blue.
