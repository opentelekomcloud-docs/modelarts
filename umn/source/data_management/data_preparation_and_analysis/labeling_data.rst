Labeling Data
=============

Model training requires a large amount of labeled data. Therefore, before training a model, label data. You can create a manual labeling job labeled by one person or by a group of persons (team labeling), or enable auto labeling to quickly label images. You can also modify existing labels, or delete them and re-label.

-  Manual labeling: allows you to manually label data.
-  Auto labeling: allows you to automatically label remaining data after a small amount of data is manually labeled.
-  Team labeling: allows you to perform collaborative labeling for a large amount of data.
