Introduction to Exporting Data
==============================

You can select data or filter data based on the filter criteria in a dataset and export to a new dataset or the specified OBS path. The historical export records can be viewed in task history.

Only datasets of image classification, object detection, and image segmentation types can be exported.

-  For image classification datasets, only the label files in TXT format can be exported.
-  For object detection datasets, only XML label files in Pascal VOC format can be exported.
-  For image segmentation datasets, only XML label files in Pascal VOC format and mask images can be exported.
