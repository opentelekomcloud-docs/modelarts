Introduction to Team Labeling
=============================

Generally, a small data labeling task can be completed by an individual. However, team work is required to label a large dataset. ModelArts provides the team labeling function. A labeling team can be formed to manage labeling for the same dataset.

.. note::

   The team labeling function supports only datasets for image classification, object detection, text classification, named entity recognition, text triplet, and speech paragraph labeling.

How to Enable Team Labeling
---------------------------

-  When creating a dataset, enable **Team Labeling** and select a team or task manager.

-  If team labeling is not enabled for a dataset that has been created, create a team labeling task to enable team labeling. For details about how to create a team labeling task, see `Creating Team Labeling Tasks <../../data_management/team_labeling/managing_team_labeling_tasks.html#creating-team-labeling-tasks>`__.
