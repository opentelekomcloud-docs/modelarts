What Do I Do If the Code Can Be Run But Cannot Be Saved, and the Error Message "save error" Is Displayed?
=========================================================================================================

If the notebook instance can run the code but cannot save it, the error message "save error" is displayed when you save the file. In most cases, this error is caused by a security policy of Web Application Firewall (WAF).

On the current page, some characters in your input or output of the code are intercepted because they are considered to be a security risk. Submit a service ticket and contact customer service to check and handle the problem.
