Introduction to Model Training
==============================

ModelArts provides model training of both the new and old versions. The new version features enhanced functions, optimized scheduling, and improved APIs. You are advised to use the new version for model training.

ModelArts provides model training for you to view the training effect, based on which you can adjust your model parameters. You can select resource pools with different instance flavors for model training. In addition to custom models, ModelArts allows you to subscribe to algorithms from AI Hub. In this way, you only need to adjust algorithm parameters to obtain your desired models.

The following provides guides for you to train models on ModelArts.

-  You can use data management to import training data for data labeling or preprocessing, and upload the labeled data to OBS. For details, see :ref:`Preparing Data <modelarts_23_0351>`.
-  For details about how to use an algorithm for model training, see :ref:`Selecting an Algorithm <modelarts_23_0230>`.
-  For details about how to create a training job on the ModelArts console, see :ref:`Creating a Training Job <modelarts_23_0286>`.
-  For details about how to view training job logs and training resource usage, see :ref:`Viewing Job Details <modelarts_23_0288>`.
-  For details about how to stop or delete a training job, see :ref:`Stopping, Rebuilding, or Searching for a Training Job <modelarts_23_0287>`.
