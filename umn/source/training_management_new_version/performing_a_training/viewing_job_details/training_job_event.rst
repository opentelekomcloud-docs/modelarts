Training Job Event
==================

Any key event of a training job will be recorded at the backend after the training job is displayed for you. You can check events on the training job details page.

This helps you better understand the running process of a training job and locate faults more accurately when a task exception occurs. You can check the following events:

-  During training job preparation, you can view the preparation actions or key events of the training job.

-  During training job runtime, you can view key information in each phase.

During the training process, key events can be manually or automatically refreshed.

Viewing Training Job Events
---------------------------

#. In the left navigation pane of the ModelArts management console, choose **Training Management** > **Training Jobs**. In the training job list, click a job name.
#. In the upper right corner of the training job details page, click **View Event** to view the event information.
