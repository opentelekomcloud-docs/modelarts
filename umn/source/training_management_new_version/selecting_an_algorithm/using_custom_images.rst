Using Custom Images
===================

The preset images can be used in most training scenarios. In certain scenarios, ModelArts allows you to create custom images to train models. Custom images can be used to train models in ModelArts only after they are uploaded to the Software Repository for Container (SWR).

Customizing an image requires a deep understanding of containers. Use this method only if the subscribed algorithms and built-in frameworks cannot meet your requirements.

For details about how to use custom images supported by the new version of training, see :ref:`Training a Model Using a Custom Image <docker-modelarts_0017>`.
