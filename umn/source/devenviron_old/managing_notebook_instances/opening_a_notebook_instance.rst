Opening a Notebook Instance
===========================

You can open a created notebook instance (that is, an instance in the **Running** state) and start coding in the development environment.

Instance Opening
----------------

-  Go to the **Jupyter Notebook** page.

   In the notebook instance list, locate the row where the target notebook instance resides and click **Open** in the **Operation** column or click the notebook instance name.

-  Go to the **JupyterLab** page.

   In the notebook instance list, select the notebook instance to be opened and click **Open JupyterLab** in the **Operation** column.

Code Development
----------------

ModelArts provides two environments for code development: Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab.

-  :ref:`Jupyter Notebook <modelarts_23_0326>`: a web-based application for interactive computing. It can be applied to full-process computing: development, documentation, running code, and presenting results.
-  :ref:`JupyterLab <modelarts_23_0209>`: an interactive development environment. It is a next-generation product of Jupyter Notebook. JupyterLab enables you to compile notebooks, operate terminals, edit MarkDown text, open interaction modes, and view CSV files and images.
