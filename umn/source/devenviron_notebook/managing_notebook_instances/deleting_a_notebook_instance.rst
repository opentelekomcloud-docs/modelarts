Deleting a Notebook Instance
============================

You can delete notebook instances that are no longer used to release resources.

#. In the notebook instance list, locate the row where the target notebook instance resides and click **Delete** in the **Operation** column. In the dialog box that is displayed, click **OK**.

   .. note::

      Deleted notebook instances cannot be recovered. Therefore, exercise caution when performing this operation. However, the files created in notebook instances are still stored in OBS specified during creation of the notebook instances.
