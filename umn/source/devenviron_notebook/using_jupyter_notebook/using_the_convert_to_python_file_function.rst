Using the Convert to Python File Function
=========================================

After code compiling is finished, you can save the entered code as a **.py** file which can be used for starting training jobs.

#. Create and open a notebook instance or open an existing notebook instance in the notebook instance list.

#. On the **Files** tab page, click **New** and choose the required AI engine from the drop-down list to access the code development page.

#. After code compiling is complete, click the save button in the upper left corner. Then, click **Convert to Python File** to convert the current **ipynb** file into a **Python** file. This function can be used to directly save your entered code as a **.py** file to the working directory.

   The generated **.py** file can be used to start ModelArts training jobs.
