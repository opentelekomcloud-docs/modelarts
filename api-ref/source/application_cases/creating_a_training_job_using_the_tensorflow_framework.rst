Creating a Training Job Using the TensorFlow Framework
======================================================

Overview
--------

This section describes how to train a model on ModelArts by calling a series of APIs.

The process for creating a training job using the TensorFlow framework is as follows:

#. Call the API in :ref:`Authentication <modelarts_03_0004>` to obtain the user token, which will be put into the request header for authentication in a subsequent request.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Querying Job Resource Specifications <modelarts_03_0072>` to obtain the resource flavors available for training jobs.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Querying Job Engine Specifications <modelarts_03_0073>` to view the engine types and versions available for training jobs.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Creating a Training Job <modelarts_03_0045>` to create a training job.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Querying the Details About a Training Job Version <modelarts_03_0047>` to query the details about the training job based on the job ID.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Obtaining the Name of a Training Job Log File <modelarts_03_0054>` to obtain the name of the training job log file.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Querying Training Job Logs <modelarts_03_0149>` to view the log details of the training job.
#. Call the API in :ref:`Deleting a Training Job <modelarts_03_0053>` to delete the training job if it is no longer needed.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have obtained the endpoints of and :ref:`ModelArts <modelarts_03_0141>`.
-  You have located the region where the service is deployed and obtained .
-  You have obtained the project ID. For details, see :ref:`Obtaining a Project ID and Name <modelarts_03_0147>`.
-  You have prepared the training code for TensorFlow. For example, you have stored the boot file **train_mnist_tf.py** in the **/test-modelarts/mnist-tensorflow-code/** directory of OBS.
-  You have prepared a dataset for the training job. For example, you have stored a training dataset in the **/test-modelarts/dataset-mnist/** directory of OBS.
-  You have created the output path of the training job, for example, **/test-modelarts/mnist-model/output/**.
