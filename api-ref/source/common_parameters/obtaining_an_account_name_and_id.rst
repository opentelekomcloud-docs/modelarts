Obtaining an Account Name and ID
================================

When you call APIs, certain requests require the account name and ID. To obtain an account name and ID, do as follows:

#. Sign up and log in to the console.

#. Hover the cursor on the username and choose **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.

   On the **API Credentials** page, view the account name and ID.
