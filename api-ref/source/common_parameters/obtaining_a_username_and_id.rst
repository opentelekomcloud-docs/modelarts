Obtaining a Username and ID
===========================

When you call APIs, certain requests require the username and ID. To obtain a username and ID, do as follows:

#. Log in to the console.

#. Hover the cursor on the username and choose **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.

   On the **API Credentials** page, view the IAM username and ID.
