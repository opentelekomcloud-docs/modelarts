Endpoints
=========

An endpoint is the **request address** for calling an API. Endpoints vary depending on services and regions. For the endpoints of all services, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.

.. important::

   If an endpoint uses a domain name, configure the hosts file in the format of "{float-ip} {service_name}.{region_id}.{external_domain_name}" on the local PC. Obtain **float-ip** from the system administrator.
