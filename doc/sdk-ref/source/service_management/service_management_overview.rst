Service Management Overview
===========================

Service management indicates deploying a model that has been successfully created as a real-time. This feature provides functions such as real-time prediction, service details query, and service log query.

The real-time services include **predictor** and **transformer**, both of which provide the functions described in the following sections. This chapter uses **predictor** as an example.

.. note::

   The sample code in this chapter is implemented in ModelArts notebook instances. If the code is used in other development environments, the session needs to be authenticated. For details about session authentication, see :ref:`Session Authentication <modelarts_04_0123>`.
